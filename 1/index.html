<p>The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a new interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers, including students.</p>

<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere.</p>

<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:
<ul>
<li><b>logical methods in computer science</b>, including classical and quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine learning;</li>
<li><b>graphical calculi</b>, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction networks;</li>
<li><b>languages and frameworks</b>, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory and game semantics;</li>
<li><b>abstract algebra and pure category theory</b>, including monoidal category theory, higher category theory,
operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy theory;</li>
<li><b>quantum algebra</b>, including quantum computation and representation theory;</li>
<li><b>tools and techniques</b>, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants, and game theory;</li>
<li><b>industrial applications</b>, including case studies and real-world problem descriptions.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many previous successful events which have taken place
over the last decade, including
<i><a href="http://categorieslogicphysics.wikidot.com/archive">Categories, Logic and Physics</a></i>,
<i><a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/clapscotland">Categories, Logic and Physics (Scotland)</a></i>,
<i><a href="http://hdra.gforge.inria.fr/">Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and Applications</a></i>,
<i><a href="http://string2017.cs.ru.nl/">String Diagrams in Computational, Logic and Physics</a></i>,
<i><a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2018/969/info.php3?wsid=969">Applied Category Theory</a></i>,
<i><a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/logic2016-3">Simons Workshop on Compositionality</a></i>,
the <i><a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/extranet/staff-material/staff-profiles/simona-paoli/yorkshire-and-midlands-category-theory-seminar-yamcats">Yorkshire and Midlands Category Theory Seminar</a></i>,
and the <i>Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic</i>.</p>

<p>The steering committee hopes that <i>SYCO</i> will become a regular fixture in the academic calendar, running regularly throughout the year, and becoming over time a recognized venue for presentation and discussion of results in an informal and friendly atmosphere. To help create this community, in the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can be accommodated in the timetable, we may choose to <i>defer</i> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. This would be done based on submission order, giving an incentive for early submission, and avoiding any need to make difficult choices between strong submissions. Deferred submissions would be accepted for presentation at any future <i>SYCO</i> meeting without the need for peer review. This will allow us to ensure that speakers have enough time to present their ideas, without creating an unnecessarily competitive atmosphere. Meetings would be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>

<!--
<p><i>Open discussion.</i> For a submission where the authors chooses to include an arXiv identifier, open discussion between authors and reviewers may take place on the open platform <a href="https://scirate.com">scirate.com</a>, to inform the confidential reviewing process. This will give authors an opportunity to engage in open and natural discussion with reviewers, allowing authors to answer questions and clarify misunderstandings, with an emphasis on building academic relationships in a way that traditional closed reviewing prevents. The steering committee requests that discussions remain constructive and civil, with reviewers advised against expressing strong criticism of submissions in this forum.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syco1">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syco1</a></li></ul>

<!--
<p>If you would like the programme committee to consider open discussion of your paper (see <i>Open discussion</i> paragraph above), please append your paper's arXiv identifier XXXX.YYYY at the end of the "Title" field on the EasyChair submission page. Any discussion would then be at the page https://scirate.com/arxiv/XXXX.YYYY. If you create an account at <a href="http://scirate.com">http://scirate.com</a>, you can configure it to send you an email whenever anybody comments on one of your own papers.</p>
-->

<p>Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to allow them to be properly considered by members of the programme committee, who will assess papers with regards to significance, clarity, correctness, and scope. We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature results. There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no specific formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long submissions authors should be aware that reviewers may not be able to read the entire document in detail.</p>

The call for papers is available <a href="call_for_papers.txt">here</a>.

<p><i>Trains.</i> With the <a href="http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/ldbboard/dep/UNI"><i>University</i> train station</a> just 100 metres from the conference venue, the best way to travel to the symposium is by train. Travel time is 11 minutes from Birmingham New Street, 27 minutes from Birmingham airport, 1 hour 7 minutes from Leicester, 1 hour 14 minutes from Sheffield, 1 hour 17 minutes from Oxford, 1 hour 34 minutes minutes from London, 2 hours 14 minutes from Leeds, and 4 hours 52 minutes from Paris. (Thanks to the time difference, this means you can take the 07:08 train from Gare du Nord and arrive in time for the first talk at 11:00.)</p>

<p><i>Planes.</i> If travelling from far afield, <a href="https://www.google.com/flights#flt=/m/05qtj.BHX.2018-09-19*BHX./m/05qtj.2018-09-21;c:GBP;e:1;sd:1;t:f">Birmingham airport</a> has flights from all over Europe, and is <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=6a2fa10e-b219-4aff-bff4-7b5c72f5b681">27 minutes by train</a> from the conference venue. Birmingham is also conveniently serviced by several other airports: <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=b86324d0-3578-40a3-a90f-94f3e6012abe">Manchester Airport</a>, <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=31248a73-4a65-44d6-acc0-637046aa88d9">Liverpool John Lennon Airport</a>, <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=2c34b94c-9d54-453c-8496-5d021a47dace">Bristol Airport</a>, and <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=ba967df4-3279-402f-a107-c671fcd8fd0d">London Gatwick Airport</a> are about 2 hours by public transport, <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=d50918d8-b8c3-4d7f-9cde-5a99ae90ba22">Heathrow Airport</a> is 2 hours 30 minutes, and <a href="https://www.trainline.com/?destination=c236d7fe-c2b2-4ff7-bac2-dd1a32b3766b&amp;origin=ff931e3d-8220-43a3-8de6-55f664bdd1e0">Stansted Airport</a> has a direct service to Birmingham New Street that takes 3 hours.</p>

<p><i>Automobiles.</i> The university has some limited <a href="https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/has/sustainable-travel/car-parking.aspx">pay-and-display parking</a> (see section "Visitor Parking"), but it is often very busy and it can be hard to find a space. A more reliable option is to park on one of the roads just south of the University which do not have parking restrictions, such as Hubert Road, Tiverton Road or Dawlish Road; these roads are a 10-minute walk to the conference venue.</p>
