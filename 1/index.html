<p>The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a new interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.</p>

<p>SYCO 1 will be held on Thursday September 20 and Friday September 21, 2018 at the School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK. We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge of open problems between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers, including students. The meeting does not have proceedings.</p>

<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>logical methods in computer science</b>, including classical and quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine learning;</li>
<li><b>graphical calculi</b>, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction networks;</li>
<li><b>languages and frameworks</b>, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory and game semantics;</li>
<li><b>abstract algebra and pure category theory</b>, including monoidal category theory, higher category theory,
operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy theory;</li>
<li><b>quantum algebra</b>, including quantum computation and representation theory;</li>
<li><b>tools and techniques</b>, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants;
<li><b>industrial applications</b>, including case studies and real-world problem descriptions.</li>
</ul>

This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many previous successful events which have taken place
over the last decade, including
<i><a href="http://categorieslogicphysics.wikidot.com/archive">Categories, Logic and Physics</a></i>,
<i><a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/clapscotland">Categories, Logic and Physics (Scotland)</a></i>,
