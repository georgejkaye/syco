<h1>Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO)</h1>
</center>


<p>The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a new interdisciplinary meeting
aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in
the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract
perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language.</p>

<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy,
and beyond, with the aim of fostering discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge of
open problems between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and
work in progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers, including students.
The meeting does not have proceedings.</p>

<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes submissions with a compositional focus
related any the following areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>logical methods in computer science</b>, including quantum and classical programming, concurrency,
natural language procesing and machine learning;</li>
<li><b>graphical calculi</b>, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction networks;</li>
<li><b>languages and frameworks</b>, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory and game semantics;</li>
<li><b>abstract algebra and pure category theory</b>, including monoidal category theory, higher category theory,
operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy theory;</li>
<li><b>quantum algebra</b>, including quantum computation and representation theory;</li>
<li><b>tools and techniques</b>, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants;
<li><b>industrial applications</b>, including case studies and real-world problem descriptions.</li>
</ul>

This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many previous successful events which have taken place
over the last decade, including
<a href="http://categorieslogicphysics.wikidot.com/archive">Categories, Logic and Physics</a>,
<a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/clapscotland">Categories, Logic and Physics (Scotland)</a>,
<a href="http://hdra.gforge.inria.fr/">Higher-Dimensional Rewriting and Applications</a>,
<a href="http://string2017.cs.ru.nl/">String Diagrams in Computational, Logic and Physics</a>,
<a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2018/969/info.php3?wsid=969">Applied Category Theory</a>,
and the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/logic2016-3">Simons Workshop on Compositionality</a>,


<h2>Meetings</h2>

Meetings will involve both invited and contributed talks. The first meeting is planned to take place over 2 days in September 2018,
with more details to follow soon. Meetings will take multiple times per year, moving around the UK, Europe, and the rest of the world,
to best serve the broad community.

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Submissions will be by EasyChair, with the possibility of submitting simply an arXiv identifier. Submissions should present original results
with sufficient detail and clarity for them to be assessed by the programme committee. We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature
results. There is no page limit or specific format requirement.</p>

<p>There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

Some funding may be available to support travel and subsistence, especially for junior
researchers who are speaking at the meeting.
