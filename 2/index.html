<p>The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a new interdisciplinary series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers, including students.</p>

<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or Masters thesis.</p>

<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:
<ul>
<li><b>logical methods in computer science</b>, including classical and quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine learning;</li>
<li><b>graphical calculi</b>, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction networks;</li>
<li><b>languages and frameworks</b>, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory and game semantics;</li>
<li><b>abstract algebra and pure category theory</b>, including monoidal category theory, higher category theory,
operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy theory;</li>
<li><b>quantum algebra</b>, including quantum computation and representation theory;</li>
<li><b>tools and techniques</b>, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants, and game theory;</li>
<li><b>industrial applications</b>, including case studies and real-world problem descriptions.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many previous successful events which have taken place
over the last decade, including

and the <i>Peripatetic Seminar in Sheaves and Logic</i>.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/syco/1/">SYCO 1</a></i> was held in September 2018 at the University of Birmingham. The steering committee hopes that <i>SYCO</i> will become a regular fixture in the academic calendar, running regularly throughout the year, and becoming over time a recognized venue for presentation and discussion of results in an informal and friendly atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

To be announced. We aim to start at 11.30 on the Monday, and finish at 17.00 on the Tuesday, to make it possible to travel in the morning and evening respectively if needed.

<h2>Registration</h2>

        <p>Please register by filling in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeePRCzbmg-wS3C2laQVfnE_hL8et7sxI9fyXFh5EpfIhkEmw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1910951876=I+am+happy+to+be+listed+as+a+participant+on+the+webpage">registration form</a>. There is no registration fee, but please register so that we can order the right amount of catering, and give you a badge. The registration deadline is Friday 7 December 2018, one week before the meeting.</p>

	<h2>Deferral</h2>
	
	The intention is for <i>SYCO</i> to be a community meeting, where people have enough time to explain their ideas, and without an unnecessarily competitive atmosphere. To encourage this, in the event that more submissions are received of an acceptable standard than can be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to <i>defer</i> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other requirements, such as ensuring a broad scientific programme. Deferred submissions can then be re-submitted to any future <i>SYCO</i> meeting, where they will be prioritised for inclusion in the programme, and where they will not need to be re-reviewed. Meetings will be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>

<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Submission is currently open. Please visit <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syco2">EasyChair</a> to make your submission.</p>

<!--
<p>If you would like the programme committee to consider open discussion of your paper (see <i>Open discussion</i> paragraph above), please append your paper's arXiv identifier XXXX.YYYY at the end of the "Title" field on the EasyChair submission page. Any discussion would then be at the page https://scirate.com/arxiv/XXXX.YYYY. If you create an account at <a href="http://scirate.com">http://scirate.com</a>, you can configure it to send you an email whenever anybody comments on one of your own papers.</p>
-->

<p>Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to allow them to be properly considered by members of the programme committee, who will assess their interest to the <i>SYCO</i> community. We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature results. There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no specific formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long submissions authors should be aware that reviewers may not be able to read the entire document in detail. Think creatively&mdash;you could submit a recent paper, or a draft notes of a project in progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>

<p>If you made a submission to <i>SYCO 1</i> which was deferred, it will not automatically be considered for <i>SYCO 2</i>; you still need to submit it again through EasyChair. Such a submission will be prioritised for inclusion in the <i>SYCO 2</i> programme. When submitting, enter the author and title information as usual into the EasyChair submission form, but in the "abstract" field, just state that it is a deferred submission and give the <i>SYCO 1</i> submission number. There is no need to attach any documents, but you can if you like, for example if the work has developed since the previous submission; in this case, please give a one-sentence summary in the "Abstract" field of the EasyChair submission form of the way it has changed.</p>
